# Wheather

This project is part of the [AppMaster](https://www.linkedin.com/company/appmasters.io/?originalSubdomain=br) mini bootcamp and consists on a website that fetch information from an [API](https://openweathermap.org) and displays it on graphs and tables.

We mainly use [React](https://reactjs.org), to handle the data from the API.

This is under construction because the bootcamp isnt over.
